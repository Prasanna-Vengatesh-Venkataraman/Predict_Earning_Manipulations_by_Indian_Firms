Prediction of Earning manipulation by Indian firms using Machine Learning models. 
Handled unbalanced data using undersampling and oversampling methods. 
Comparison of the models performance against the Beneish model developed in 1999. 
Comparison of performance between Machine Learning models to determine the best model. 
ML Models built: Decision Tree (CART), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ada-Boosting. 
Optimal cut-off points for regression determined using: Youden's Index & Cost based method. 
Chose Sensitivity as the major performance indicator to ensure models predict the manipulators correctly.
