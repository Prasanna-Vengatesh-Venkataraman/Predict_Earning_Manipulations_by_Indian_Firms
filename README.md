# Predict Earning Manipulations by Indian Firms

Prediction of Earning manipulation by Indian firms using Machine Learning models. 
Handled unbalanced data using undersampling and oversampling methods. 
Comparison of the models performance against Beneish model developed in 1999. 
Comaprison of performance between Machine Learning models to determine best model. 
ML Modles built: Decision Tree (CART), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Ada-Boosting. 
Optimal cut-off points for regression determined using: Youden's Index & Cost based method. 
Chose Sensitivity as the major performance indicator to ensure models predict the manipulators correctly. 

Data present in "Earning Manipultions Data.xlsx" file.
